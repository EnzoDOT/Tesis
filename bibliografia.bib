abstract = {Indirect optical spectroscopy or tomography, that is, mapping of optical properties in scattering and absorption inside a medium given a set of measurements at the boundaries, is highly dependent on the radiative transfer model used to track radiative energy propagation in semi-transparent materials. In the first part of this study, a numerical tool adapted for treating radiative transfer in the frame of short-pulsed laser beam interaction with non-homogeneous matter has been presented. In this paper, it is intended to show how such numerical tools can undergo inversion through adjoint treatment or reverse differentiation. Adjoint models, as well as reverse differentiation, are used in order to allow an efficient computation of the gradient, in the unknown optical parameters space, of an objective or cost function estimating the residual between data obtained at the boundary and predictions by numerical simulations. This gradient is a crucial indication as to update, through line minimization, the set of internal optical properties of the medium. First, the theoretical background of the inverse treatments, both reverse differentiation and adjoint model, for the transient radiative transfer equation model introduced in Part I is developed. Second, different reconstruction configurations are presented. Time-dependent sampling and time filtering effects of the measurements are addressed. Image reconstructions from simulated data are achieved for material phantoms of simple geometry. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsveier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A summary is described about nuclear power reactors analyses and simulations in the last decades with emphasis in recent developments for full 3D reactor core simulations using highly advanced computing techniques. The development of the computer code AZKIND is presented as a practical exercise. AZKIND is based on multi-group time dependent neutron diffusion theory. A space discretization is applied using the nodal finite element method RTN-0; for time discretization the $\theta$-method is used. A high-performance com-
puting (HPC) methodology was implemented to solve the linear algebraic system. The numerical solution of large matrix-vector systems for full 3D reactor cores is achieved with acceleration tools from the open-source PARALUTION library. This acceleration consists of threading thousands of arithmetic operations into GPUs. The acceleration is demonstrated for different nuclear fuel arrays giving extremely large matrices. To consider the
thermal-hydraulic (TH) feedback, several strategies are nowadays implemented and under development. In AZKIND, a simplified coupling between the neutron kinetics (NK) model and TH model is implemented for reactor core simulations, for which the TH variables are used to update nuclear data (cross sections). Test cases have been documented in the literature and demonstrate the HPC capabilities in the field of nuclear reactors analysis.},

However, the role of insulin/IGF-1 signaling in human survival remains controversial. The aim of this study was to test whether circulating IGF-1 axis parameters associate with old age survival and functional status in nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study. This study examined 858 Dutch nonagenarian (males≥89 years; females≥91 years) siblings from 409 families, without selection on health or demographic characteristics. Nonagenarians were divided over sex-specific strata according to their levels of IGF-1, IGF binding protein 3 and IGF-1/IGFBP3 molar ratio. We found that lower IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratios were associated with improved survival: nonagenarians in the quartile of the lowest ratio had a lower estimated hazard ratio (95{\%} confidence interval) of 0.73 (0.59 – 0.91) compared to the quartile with the highest ratio (ptrend=0.002). Functional status was assessed by (Instrumental) Activities of Daily Living ((I)ADL) scales. Compared to those in the quartile with the highest IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratio, nonagenarians in the lowest quartile had higher scores for ADL (ptrend=0.001) and IADL (ptrend=0.003). These findings suggest that IGF-1 axis parameters are associated with increased old age survival and better functional status in nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study.},

The effects of absorption, multiple scattering, and collimated incidence were considered. Since then, the numerical method has been utilized to study radiative heat transfer in one- and multi-dimensional rectangular, spherical and cylindrical geometries. In this article, the formulation of the discrete-ordinates method is described for computing radiative transfer in a one-dimensional (1D) slab and two-dimensional (2D) rectangular geometries, including the effects of absorbing, emitting and scattering constituents. Both the strengths and the weaknesses of this numerical approach are addressed. The accuracy of available results obtained by utilizing the discrete-ordinates method is compared with other methods of solution for several representative cases. It is evident that major advances have been made related to the development and application of the discrete-ordinates method in multi-dimensional systems. However, much more work remains to be done with the development of this classical technique, including, among others, a more effective treatment of nongray radiative properties of molecular gases and turbulence, as well as a removal of false scattering. {\textcopyright}1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Recent pressure vessel fast fluence calculations have revealed numerical difficulties (spatial oscillations) in the SN solutions, which have persisted in spite of mesh refinement. It is demonstrated that other shielding/deep-penetration applications may be affected; in fact, any SN solution in which the uncollided flux component is significant is likely to exhibit such difficulties. Test problems have been designed to characterize and understand numerical difficulties. Main analyses are performed using the diamond-difference (DD) scheme, which is linear and forms the basis for other (more complex) low-order differencing schemes. The genesis of oscillations is shown to be related to several effects specific for multidimensional geometries as follows: ambiguity in the interpretation of boundary conditions, discontinuities, and different directions of particle streaming and differencing. It has further been explained why the mesh refinement does not produce the intuitively expected results. Other low-order differencing schemes (e.g., the DD with negative flux fixup and the 9-weighted) may partly remedy the situation by reducing the oscillations or by eliminating the oscillations at a cost of "oversmoothing" the results everywhere (e.g., the zero-weighted scheme). These schemes provide more robust solutions, but the inherent difficulties (although reduced) still remain. Types of discontinuities that trigger the oscillations are also examined; it is difficult to envisage an actual practical application free of such discontinuities. The magnitude of numerical difficulties (oscillations) and their practical relevance will depend on all SN model features, the differencing scheme being used, and the application requirements, but this study has shown that they are inherent to multidimensional finite-difference SN algorithms.},

abstract = {A new grid-based Boltzmann equation solver, Acuros, was developed specifically for performing accurate and rapid radiotherapy dose calculations. In this study we benchmarked its performance against Monte Carlo for 6 and 18 MV photon beams in heterogeneous media. Acuros solves the coupled Boltzmann transport equations for neutral and charged particles on a locally adaptive Cartesian grid. The Acuros solver is an optimized rewrite of the general purpose Attila software, and for comparable accuracy levels, it is roughly an order of magnitude faster than Attila. Comparisons were made between Monte Carlo (EGSnrc) and Acuros for 6 and 18 MV photon beams impinging on a slab phantom comprising tissue, bone and lung materials. To provide an accurate reference solution, Monte Carlo simulations were run to a tight statistical uncertainty ({\$}\sigma{\$} ≈ 0.1{\%}) and fine resolution (1-2 mm). Acuros results were output on a 2 mm cubic voxel grid encompassing the entire phantom. Comparisons were also made for a breast treatment plan on an anthropomorphic phantom. For the slab phantom in regions where the dose exceeded 10{\%} of the maximum dose, agreement between Acuros and Monte Carlo was within 2{\%} of the local dose or 1 mm distance to agreement. For the breast case, agreement was within 2{\%} of local dose or 2 mm distance to agreement in 99.9{\%} of voxels where the dose exceeded 10{\%} of the prescription dose. Elsewhere, in low dose regions, agreement for all cases was within 1{\%} of the maximum dose. Since all Acuros calculations required less than 5 min on a dual-core two-processor workstation, it is efficient enough for routine clinical use. Additionally, since Acuros calculation times are only weakly dependent on the number of beams, Acuros may ideally be suited to arc therapies, where current clinical algorithms may incur long calculation times. {\textcopyright}2010 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

Based on the theory of scalar hyperbolic equations in the Fourier domain, we show that DD performs very well when the boundary data are smooth and the absorption coefficient small. However, because high frequency modes are not damped at all by DD even in the dissipative case, several unphysical modes appear when the boundary conditions are not so smooth.

Theorems are given to explain this effect. First, following O'Hara and Smith in the 1960s, the phenomenon is explained as a consequence of aliasing of coefficients in Chebyshev expansions. Then another explanation is offered based on the interpretation of a quadrature formula as a rational approximation of log((z + 1)/(Z - 1)) in the complex plane.

We assume that the dose should be delivered to a target volume which moves over time. We formulate this as an optimal control problem and derive closed-loop control laws for the dose delivery problem using boundary and distributed control. Optimality conditions are derived. For the construction of the closed-loop control laws we use an inexact variant of model predictive control called instantaneous control. We compare numerical results obtained with instantaneous control to those obtained by optimal open-loop control, and present numerical simulations in one and two spatial dimensions.

abstract = {The contribution of this paper relies in the development of numerical algorithms for the mathematical treatment of specular reflection on borders when dealing with the numerical solution of radiative transfer problems. The radiative transfer equation being integro-differential, the discrete ordinates method allows to write down a set of semi-discrete equations in which weights are to be calculated. The calculation of these weights is well known to be based on either a quadrature or on angular discretization, making the use of such method straightforward for the state equation. Also, the diffuse contribution of reflection on borders is usually well taken into account. However, the calculation of accurate partition ratio coefficients is much more tricky for the specular condition applied on arbitrary geometrical borders. This paper presents algorithms that calculate analytically partition ratio coefficients needed in numerical treatments. The developed algorithms, combined with a decentered finite element scheme, are validated with the help of comparisons with analytical solutions before being applied on complex geometries.},

abstract = {The presented study consists of two parts. The overall goal is to introduce and experimentally test a novel optical tomographic imaging algorithm that is based on the equation of radiative transfer. Using the equation of radiative transfer rather than the diiusion equation permits the consideration of highly scattering media that contain void-like regions that have very low absorption and scattering coeecients. In part I we concentrate on the detailed description and evaluation of a numerical forward model that accurately describes photon propagation in such media. In part II we focus on the inclusion of this forward model into a model-based iterative image reconstruction (MOBIIR) scheme. Using the MOBIIR scheme one can determine the spatial distribution of optical properties inside highly scattering media from measurements acquired on the surface of the medium. The mathematical and numerical background for the reconstruction algorithm, especially the adjoint diierentiation scheme for the gradient calculation, will be presented. The code is tested with experimental data from tissue-phantoms that contain water-{\"{y}}lled, void-like regions. The forward model to be described in part I is based on an upwind-diierence discrete-ordinate for-mulation of the time-independent equation of radiative transfer. The upwind-diierence representation has the advantage that it provides a convenient mathematical framework for calculating the derivative of the with respect to the optical parameters using an adjoint diierentiation technique, to be de-scribed in part II. The performance of the forward model is tested with experimental data obtained from homogeneous tissue-phantoms and from phantoms that contain void-like regions. We {\"{y}}nd good agreement *},

A theme of the review is the complexity of PDT dosimetry due to the dynamic nature of the three essential components -- light, photosensitizer and oxygen. Considerable progress has been made in understanding the problem and in developing instruments to measure all three, so that optimization of individual PDT treatments is becoming a feasible target.

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2015. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. Remote sensing of the nighttime OI 135.6 nm emissions has been a widely used method for measuring the F region ionospheric plasma densities. In this work, we first develop a comprehensive radiative transfer model from first principles to investigate the effects of different physical processes on the production and transport of the 135.6 nm photons in the ionosphere and then propose a new approach for estimating electron densities from the nightglow. The forward modeling investigation indicates that under certain conditions mutual neutralization can contribute up to ∼38{\%} of the total production of the nighttime 135.6 nm emissions. Moreover, depending on the ionospheric conditions, resonant scattering by atomic oxygen and pure absorption by oxygen molecules can reduce the limb brightness observed by satellite-borne instruments by up to ∼40{\%} while enhancing the brightness viewing in the nadir direction by typically ∼25{\%}. Further analysis shows that without properly addressing these effects in the inversion process, the peak electron density in the F region (NmF2) obtained using limb observations can be overestimated by up to ∼24{\%}. For accurate estimation of the ionospheric electron density, we develop a new type of inverse model that accounts for the effects of mutual neutralization, resonant scattering, and pure absorption. This inversion method requires the knowledge of O and O 2 densities in order to solve the radiative transfer equations. Application of the inverse model to the nighttime ionosphere in the noiseless cases demonstrates that the electron density can be accurately quantified with only ∼1{\%} error in NmF2 and hmF2.},

The new scheme is based on the recently introduced accelerated FC method, which enables use of highly accurate Fourier expansions as the main building block of general-domain PDE solvers. Previous FC-based PDE solvers are restricted to linear scalar equations with constant coefficients. The FC methodology presented in this text thus constitutes a significant generalization of the previous FC schemes, as it yields general-domain FC solvers for nonlinear systems of PDEs. While not restricted to periodic boundary conditions and therefore applicable to general boundary value problems on arbitrary domains, the proposed algorithm inherits many of the highly desirable properties arising from rapidly convergent Fourier expansions, including high-order convergence, essentially spectrally accurate dispersion relations, and much milder CFL constraints than those imposed by polynomial-based spectral methods-since, for example, the spectral radius of the FC first derivative grows linearly with the number of spatial discretization points. We demonstrate the accuracy and optimal parallel efficiency of the algorithm in a variety of scientific and engineering contexts relevant to fluid-dynamics and nonlinear acoustics. {\textcopyright}2011 Elsevier Inc.},

The forward model is solved by using an even-parity formulation of the ERT which lends itself to a finite-element discretization method. The finite-element technique provides the suitable framework for predicting light propagation in arbitrarily shaped three-dimensional media. For an efficient way of calculating the gradient of the objective function we have implemented an adjoint differentiation scheme. Initial reconstruction results using synthetic data from simple media and a three-dimensional mesh of the human forehead illustrate the performance of the code. (C) 2003 SPIE and IST.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Abstract: We study theoretically the double ionization of helium by 6 MeV proton impact. For such fast projectiles, when considering the projectile-target interaction to first order, the four-body Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation reduces to solving a three-body driven equation. We solve it with a generalized Sturmian functions approach and, without evaluating a transition matrix element, we extract the transition amplitude directly from the asymptotic limit of the first order scattering solution. Fivefold differential cross sections (FDCS) are calculated for the double ionization process for a number of coplanar kinematical situations. We present a detailed theory-experiment comparison for intermediate momentum transfers (from 0.8 to 1.2 a.u. and from 1.4 to 2.0 a.u.). In spite of some experimental restrictions (energy and momentum ranges) and the low count rates, we found that our theoretical description provides a very satisfactory reproduction of the measured data on relative scale. We then explore how the binary, recoil and back-to-back structures change with increasing momentum transfers (0.853 to 1.656, to 3.0 a.u.). Within the impulsive regime, with a momentum transfer of 3.0 a.u., we also analyze the FDCS for different excess energies. Finally, in analogy to an experimentalist gathering electrons with different excess energies to obtain enough counts, we provide a collective FDCS prediction that hopefully will stimulate further measurements.

We present ab initio calculations for the double ionization of helium by fast proton impact, using the generalized-Sturmian-functions methodology and within a perturbative treatment of the projectile-target interaction. The cross-section information is extracted from the asymptotic behavior of the numerical three-body function that describes the emission process. Our goal is to provide benchmark first-order Born fully differential cross sections with which one may investigate the suitability of transition matrices calculated using approximate analytic-type solutions for the double continuum (the choice of effective charges or effective momenta to partially account for the internal target interactions being, to some extent, arbitrary). We also provide fully differential cross sections for the low-ejection-energy regime, which is beyond the suitable range of such perturbative methods. We find, however, that the effective momentum approach allows one to get at least a rough characterization of the most dominant physical process involved. We also compare our calculations with the only available relative experimental set, showing an agreement in shape that can be well understood within the given momentum transfer regime.},

@article{Bruno2010,
abstract = {We introduce a new methodology for the numerical solution of Partial Differential Equations in general spatial domains: our algorithms are based on the use of the well-known Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) approach in conjunction with a certain "Fourier continuation" (FC) method for the resolution of the Gibbs phenomenon. Unlike previous alternating direction methods of order higher than one, which can only deliver unconditional stability for rectangular domains, the present high-order algorithms possess the desirable property of unconditional stability for general domains; the computational time required by our algorithms to advance a solution by one time-step, in turn, grows in an essentially linear manner with the number of spatial discretization points used. In this paper we demonstrate the FC-AD methodology through a variety of examples concerning the Heat and Laplace Equations in two and three-dimensional domains with smooth boundaries. Applications of the FC-AD methodology to Hyperbolic PDEs together with a theoretical discussion of the method will be put forth in a subsequent contribution. The numerical examples presented in this text demonstrate the unconditional stability and high-order convergence of the proposed algorithms, as well the very significant improvements they can provide (in one of our examples we demonstrate a one thousand improvement factor) over the computing times required by some of the most efficient alternative general-domain solvers. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Results are presented for various aspect ratios, media extinction properties, and loading parameters. The standard discrete ordinates solution exhibits anomalies in the flux leaving the bottom which are attributed to 'ray-effects'. Large errors are observed when the aspect ralio is small.

abstract = {Iterative approaches to the nonlinear inverse transport problem are described, which give rise to the structure that best predicts a set of transport observations. Such methods are based on minimizing a global error functional measuring the discrepancy between predicted and observed transport data. Required for this minimization is the functional gradient (Frechet derivative) of the global error evaluated with respect to a set of unknown material parameters (specifying boundary locations, scattering cross sections, etc.) which are to be determined. It is shown how this functional gradient is obtained from numerical solutions to the forward and adjoint transport problems computed once per iteration. This approach is not only far more efficient, but also more accurate, than a finite-difference method for computing the gradient of the global error. The general technique can be applied to inverse-transport problems of all descriptions, provided only that solutions to the forward and adjoint problems can be found numerically. As an illustration, two inverse problems are treated: the reconstruction of an anisotropic scattering function in a one-dimensional homogeneous slab and the two-dimensional “imaging” of a spatially-varying scattering cross section},

In this interpretation, the geometric patterns onto which the residuals are backprojected are given by the same absorption and scattering transport sensitivity functions which decompose the forward residual operator. Moreover, the 'backtransport' procedure, which has been introduced in an earlier paper by the author, can then be interpreted as an efficient scheme for 'backprojecting' all (filtered) residuals corresponding to one source position simultaneously into the parameter space by just solving one adjoint transport problem.

abstract = {A three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulation of transient radiative transfer is performed for short pulse laser transport in scattering and absorbing media. Experimental results of a 60 ps pulse laser transmission in scattering media are presented and compared with simulation. Good agreement between the Monte Carlo simulation and experimental measurement is found. The refractive index of the scattering particles is found to influence strongly the prediction of transmitted pulse shape. The temporal shape of the transmittance is very weakly influenced by the output detector angle for a diffuse medium. Scaled isotropic scattering modeling is shown to be insufficient in transient three-dimensional radiative transfer for early times. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The presented study consists of two parts. The overall goal is to introduce and experimentally test a novel optical tomographic imaging algorithm that is based on the equation of radiative transfer. Using the equation of radiative transfer rather than the diiusion equation permits the consideration of highly scattering media that contain void-like regions that have very low absorption and scattering coeecients. In part I we concentrate on the detailed description and evaluation of a numerical forward model that accurately describes photon propagation in such media. In part II we focus on the inclusion of this forward model into a model-based iterative image reconstruction (MOBIIR) scheme. Using the MOBIIR scheme one can determine the spatial distribution of optical properties inside highly scattering media from measurements acquired on the surface of the medium. The mathematical and numerical background for the reconstruction algorithm, especially the adjoint diierentiation scheme for the gradient calculation, will be presented. The code is tested with experimental data from tissue-phantoms that contain water-{\"{y}}lled, void-like regions. The forward model to be described in part I is based on an upwind-diierence discrete-ordinate for-mulation of the time-independent equation of radiative transfer. The upwind-diierence representation has the advantage that it provides a convenient mathematical framework for calculating the derivative of the with respect to the optical parameters using an adjoint diierentiation technique, to be de-scribed in part II. The performance of the forward model is tested with experimental data obtained from homogeneous tissue-phantoms and from phantoms that contain void-like regions. We {\"{y}}nd good agreement *},

The scheme builds on the concept of model-based iterative image reconstruction, in which a forward model provides prediction of detector readings, and a gradient-based updating scheme minimizes an appropriately defined objective function. The forward model is solved by using an even-parity formulation of the ERT which lends itself to a finite-element discretization method. The finite-element technique provides the suitable framework for predicting light propagation in arbitrarily shaped three-dimensional media. For an efficient way of calculating the gradient of the objective function we have implemented an adjoint differentiation scheme. Initial reconstruction results using synthetic data from simple media and a three-dimensional mesh of the human forehead illustrate the performance of the code. (C) 2003 SPIE and IST.},

The new scheme is based on the recently introduced accelerated FC method, which enables use of highly accurate Fourier expansions as the main building block of general-domain PDE solvers. Previous FC-based PDE solvers are restricted to linear scalar equations with constant coefficients. The FC methodology presented in this text thus constitutes a significant generalization of the previous FC schemes, as it yields general-domain FC solvers for nonlinear systems of PDEs. While not restricted to periodic boundary conditions and therefore applicable to general boundary value problems on arbitrary domains, the proposed algorithm inherits many of the highly desirable properties arising from rapidly convergent Fourier expansions, including high-order convergence, essentially spectrally accurate dispersion relations, and much milder CFL constraints than those imposed by polynomial-based spectral methods-since, for example, the spectral radius of the FC first derivative grows linearly with the number of spatial discretization points. We demonstrate the accuracy and optimal parallel efficiency of the algorithm in a variety of scientific and engineering contexts relevant to fluid-dynamics and nonlinear acoustics. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses light-activated drugs to treat diseases ranging from cancer to age-related macular degeneration and antibiotic-resistant infections. This paper reviews the current status of PDT with an emphasis on the contributions of physics, biophysics and technology, and the challenges remaining in the optimization and adoption of this treatment modality. A theme of the review is the complexity of PDT dosimetry due to the dynamic nature of the three essential components -- light, photosensitizer and oxygen. Considerable progress has been made in understanding the problem and in developing instruments to measure all three, so that optimization of individual PDT treatments is becoming a feasible target. The final section of the review introduces some new frontiers of research including low dose rate (metronomic) PDT, two-photon PDT, activatable PDT molecular beacons and nanoparticle-based PDT.},

abstract = {Observations have been obtained to verify the existence of diffuse interstellar radiation. A Fabry photometer, attached to the 40-inch refractor at the Yerkes Observatory, was used to measure the brightness of regions over a wide range of galactic latitude. The intensities in the photographic region of the spectrum were calibrated by means of the Polar Sequence stars. The mean of four such runs across the Milky Way, on circles of nearly constant longitude, l = 40 degrees, shows a maximum of brightness of 80 stars of the tenth magnitude per square degree for the diffuse extra-terrestrial radiation. The mean of three runs near l = 140 degrees shows a maximum of 35 in the same units. It is shown that the observed intensity of diffuse light may be explained as scattered stellar radiation if the phase function governing the scattering of starlight by the interstellar matter is strongly forward- throwing. The concentration of the diffuse light toward the galactic circle is also in agreement with this property of the phase function. The observations also indicate that the scattering efficiency, or albedo, of the particles is greater than 0.3.},

abstract = {In the discrete ordinates method (DOM), the normalized condition for the numerical quadrature of some complex scattering phase functions may not be satisfied. In this paper, a revised discrete ordinates method (RDOM) is developed to overcome this problem, in which a renormalizing factor is added into the numerical quadrature of in-scattering term. The RDOM is used to solve the radiative transfer problem in one-dimensional anisotropically scattering media with complex phase function. The radiative heat fluxes obtained by the RDOM are compared with those obtained by the conventional discrete ordinates method (CDOM) and Monte Carlo method. The results show the RDOM can overcome the false scattering resulted from the numerical quadrature of in-scattering term and improve largely the accuracy of solution of the radiative transfer equation by comparison with the CDOM. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2015. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. Remote sensing of the nighttime OI 135.6 nm emissions has been a widely used method for measuring the F region ionospheric plasma densities. In this work, we first develop a comprehensive radiative transfer model from first principles to investigate the effects of different physical processes on the production and transport of the 135.6 nm photons in the ionosphere and then propose a new approach for estimating electron densities from the nightglow. The forward modeling investigation indicates that under certain conditions mutual neutralization can contribute up to ∼38{\%} of the total production of the nighttime 135.6 nm emissions. Moreover, depending on the ionospheric conditions, resonant scattering by atomic oxygen and pure absorption by oxygen molecules can reduce the limb brightness observed by satellite-borne instruments by up to ∼40{\%} while enhancing the brightness viewing in the nadir direction by typically ∼25{\%}. Further analysis shows that without properly addressing these effects in the inversion process, the peak electron density in the F region (NmF2) obtained using limb observations can be overestimated by up to ∼24{\%}. For accurate estimation of the ionospheric electron density, we develop a new type of inverse model that accounts for the effects of mutual neutralization, resonant scattering, and pure absorption. This inversion method requires the knowledge of O and O 2 densities in order to solve the radiative transfer equations. Application of the inverse model to the nighttime ionosphere in the noiseless cases demonstrates that the electron density can be accurately quantified with only ∼1{\%} error in NmF2 and hmF2.},

Results are as the followings: the composition of 14C and 10Be in moderator could be the signature of total flux, the mainly fission products of radioactive nuclides, 144Ce, 134Cs, 147Pm, 154Eu, 90Sr and 137Cs, could be the signature of reprocessing time and times of reprocessing, and the correlated nuclide number ratio of 238Pu vs. total Pu could be the signature of reactor type. Thus, for nuclear forensic analysis on the dismantlement of production reactor, the sampling data of the nuclides 14C and 10Be in moderator could be used to identify the operation history of the reactor, and the sampling data of the main fission product of radioactive nuclides in the reprocessing pool could be used to identify the times of reprocessing. For nuclear forensic analysis on nonproliferation cases, the reactor type of intercepted material could be identified by analyzing the correlated nuclides ratios, 238Pu v.s. total Pu and 242Pu v.s. 240Pu, which is essential to narrow down the possible origination range of the intercepted material.},

The development of the computer code AZKIND is presented as a practical exercise. AZKIND is based on multi-group time dependent neutron diffusion theory. A space discretization is applied using the nodal finite element method RTN-0; for time discretization the $\theta$-method is used. A high-performance com-
puting (HPC) methodology was implemented to solve the linear algebraic system. The numerical solution of large matrix-vector systems for full 3D reactor cores is achieved with acceleration tools from the open-source PARALUTION library. This acceleration consists of threading thousands of arithmetic operations into GPUs. The acceleration is demonstrated for different nuclear fuel arrays giving extremely large matrices. To consider the
thermal-hydraulic (TH) feedback, several strategies are nowadays implemented and under development. In AZKIND, a simplified coupling between the neutron kinetics (NK) model and TH model is implemented for reactor core simulations, for which the TH variables are used to update nuclear data (cross sections). Test cases have been documented in the literature and demonstrate the HPC capabilities in the field of nuclear reactors analysis.},

abstract = {This paper introduces alternating-direction implicit (ADI) solvers of higher order of time-accuracy (orders two to six) for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in two- and three-dimensional curvilinear domains. The higher-order accuracy in time results from 1) An application of the backward differentiation formulae time-stepping algorithm (BDF) in conjunction with 2) A BDF-like extrapolation technique for certain components of the nonlinear terms (which makes use of nonlinear solves unnecessary), as well as 3) A novel application of the Douglas-Gunn splitting (which greatly facilitates handling of boundary conditions while preserving higher-order accuracy in time). As suggested by our theoretical analysis of the algorithms for a variety of special cases, an extensive set of numerical experiments clearly indicate that all of the BDF-based ADI algorithms proposed in this paper are "quasi-unconditionally stable" in the following sense: each algorithm is stable for all couples (h, $\Delta$t) of spatial and temporal mesh sizes in a problem-dependent rectangular neighborhood of the form (0, Mh)×(0, Mt). In other words, for each fixed value of $\delta$t below a certain threshold, the Navier-Stokes solvers presented in this paper are stable for arbitrarily small spatial mesh-sizes. The second-order formulation has further been rigorously shown to be unconditionally stable for linear hyperbolic and parabolic equations in two-dimensional space. Although implicit ADI solvers for the Navier-Stokes equations with nominal second-order of temporal accuracy have been proposed in the past, the algorithms presented in this paper are the first ADI-based Navier-Stokes solvers for which second-order or better accuracy has been verified in practice under non-trivial (non-periodic) boundary conditions.},

Such schemes enable generating numerical results for averaged scalar fluxes over specified regions of the domain with high number (up to 105) of directions per octant. Two different nodal approaches, the ADO and AHOT-N0 methods, are utilized to obtain the numerical results of interest. The AHOT-N0 solutions on a sequence of refined meshes are then used to develop an asymptotic analysis of the spatial discretization error in order to derive a reference solution. It was more clearly observed that the spatial discretization error converges asymptotically with second order for the source region with all four quadratures employed, while for the other regions refined meshes along with tighter convergence criterion must be applied to evidence the same behavior. However, in that case, some differences among the four quadrature schemes results were found.},

abstract = {A method is presented, based upon the Stieltjes method (1884), for the determination of non-classical Gauss-type quadrature rules, and the associated sets of abscissae and weights. The method is then used to generate a number of quadrature sets, to arbitrary order, which are primarily aimed at deterministic transport calculations. The quadrature rules and sets detailed include arbitrary order reproductions of those presented by Abu-Shumays in [4,8] (known as the QR sets, but labelled QRA here), in addition to a number of new rules and associated sets; these are generated in a similar way, and we label them the QRS quadrature sets.The method presented here shifts the inherent difficulty (encountered by Abu-Shumays) associated with solving the non-linear moment equations, particular to the required quadrature rule, to one of the determination of non-classical weight functions and the subsequent calculation of various associated inner products. Once a quadrature rule has been written in a standard form, with an associated weight function having been identified, the calculation of the required inner products is achieved using specific variable transformations, in addition to the use of rapid, highly accurate quadrature suited to this purpose. The associated non-classical Gauss quadrature sets can then be determined, and this can be done to any order very rapidly. In this paper, instead of listing weights and abscissae for the different quadrature sets detailed (of which there are a number), the MATLAB code written to generate them is included as Appendix D.The accuracy and efficacy (in a transport setting) of the quadrature sets presented is not tested in this paper (although the accuracy of the QRA quadrature sets has been studied in [12,13]), but comparisons to tabulated results listed in [8] are made. When comparisons are made with one of the azimuthal QRA sets detailed in [8], the inherent difficulty in the method of generation, used there, becomes apparent, with the highest order tabulated sets showing unexpected anomalies.Although not in an actual transport setting, the accuracy of the sets presented here is assessed to some extent, by using them to approximate integrals (over an octant of the unit sphere) of various high order spherical harmonics. When this is done, errors in the tabulated QRA sets present themselves at the highest tabulated orders, whilst combinations of the new QRS quadrature sets offer some improvements in accuracy over the original QRA sets.Finally, in order to offer a quick, visual understanding of the various quadrature sets presented, when combined to give product sets for the purposes of integrating functions confined to the surface of a sphere, three-dimensional representations of points located on an octant of the unit sphere (as in [8,12]) are shown.},

abstract = {The asymptotic convergence of the angular discretization error in the scalar flux solution of the particle transport equation computed with the Discrete Ordinates (SN) method with increasing quadrature order is examined. Five selected angular quadrature types are considered: Level Symmetric (LS), Legendre-Chebyshev Quadrangular (LCQ), Legendre-Chebyshev Triangular(LCT), Quadruple Range (QR) and Quadruple Range Spence-type (QRS) quadrature sets. We relate the SN angular discretization error to the quadrature error, and split the total flux into the uncollided flux and the fully collided flux, and then we verify the uncollided scalar flux error and the fully collided scalar flux error separately. After developing the theoretical basis for the relationship between true solution regularity and quadrature rule error, we employ a two-dimensional problem to verify the observed and theoretical convergence orders for the region-averaged uncollided and fully collided scalar flux errors. Numerical results show that the angular discretization errors in the region-averaged scalar flux obtained by different quadrature types converge with different rates, that are commensurate with the regularity order of the exact angular flux within the quadrature-designed integration interval. The angular discretization error in the uncollided region-averaged scalar flux obtained by LC class quadratures converges linearly, and the error obtained by QR class quadrature sets converges quadratically. The angular discretization error in the fully collided region-averaged scalar flux converges linearly for LC class quadratures, and faster-than-second order for QR class quadrature sets.},

abstract = {To determine the angular discretization error asymptotic convergence rate of the uncollided scalar flux computed with the Discrete Ordinates (S (Formula presented.)) method, a comprehensive theory of the regularity order with respect to the azimuthal angle of the exact pointwise SN uncollided angular flux is derived based on the integral form of the transport equation in two-dimensional Cartesian geometry. With this theory, the regularity order of the pointwise (Formula presented.) uncollided angular flux can be estimated for a given problem configuration. Our new theory inspired a novel Modified Simpson's (MS) quadrature that converges the uncollided scalar flux faster than any of the traditional quadratures by avoiding integration across points of irregularity in the azimuthal angle. Numerical results successfully verify our new theory in four variants of a test configuration, and the angular discretization errors in the corresponding scalar flux computed with conventional angular quadrature types and with our new quadrature types are found to converge with different orders. The error convergence rates obtained with traditional quadrature types are limited by the regularity order of the exact angular flux and the quadrature's integration intervals while our new MS quadrature types converge with order two to four times higher than traditional quadratures. A detailed study of oscillations observed in certain quadrature errors is provided by introducing the effective length of the irregular interval and the associated oscillating function.},

For high resolution DOT, accurate and fast computation of light propagation in biological tissue is desirable. This paper proposes a space-time hybrid model for numerical modeling based on the radiative transfer and diffusion equations (RTE and DE, respectively) in random media under refractive-index mismatching. In the proposed model, the RTE and DE regions are separated into space and time by using a crossover length and the time from the ballistic regime to the diffusive regime, $\rho$DA{\~{}}10/$\mu$t' and tDA{\~{}}20/v$\mu$t' where $\mu$t' and v represent a reduced transport coefficient and light velocity, respectively.

abstract = {Reduced insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling has been associated with longevity in various model organisms. However, the role of insulin/IGF-1 signaling in human survival remains controversial. The aim of this study was to test whether circulating IGF-1 axis parameters associate with old age survival and functional status in nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study. This study examined 858 Dutch nonagenarian (males≥89 years; females≥91 years) siblings from 409 families, without selection on health or demographic characteristics. Nonagenarians were divided over sex-specific strata according to their levels of IGF-1, IGF binding protein 3 and IGF-1/IGFBP3 molar ratio. We found that lower IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratios were associated with improved survival: nonagenarians in the quartile of the lowest ratio had a lower estimated hazard ratio (95{\%} confidence interval) of 0.73 (0.59 – 0.91) compared to the quartile with the highest ratio (ptrend=0.002). Functional status was assessed by (Instrumental) Activities of Daily Living ((I)ADL) scales. Compared to those in the quartile with the highest IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratio, nonagenarians in the lowest quartile had higher scores for ADL (ptrend=0.001) and IADL (ptrend=0.003). These findings suggest that IGF-1 axis parameters are associated with increased old age survival and better functional status in nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study.},

abstract = {A new 2D neutron transport code AutoMOC for arbitrary geometry has been developed. This code is based on the method of characteristics (MOCs) and the customization of AutoCAD. The MOC solves the neutron transport equation along characteristic lines. It is independent of the geometric shape of boundaries and regions. So theoretically, this method can be used to solve the neutron transport equation in highly complex geometries. However, it is important to describe the geometry and calculate intersection points of each characteristic line with every boundary and region in advance. In complex geometries, due to the complications of treating the arbitrary domain, the selection of geometric shapes and efficiency of ray tracing are generally limited. The geometry treatment through the customization of AutoCAD, a widely used computer-aided design software package, is given in this paper. Thanks to the powerful capability of AutoCAD, the description of arbitrary geometry becomes quite convenient. Moreover, with the language Visual Basic for Applications (VBAs), AutoCAD can be customized to carry out the ray tracing procedure with a high flexibility in geometry. The numerical results show that AutoMOC can solve 2D neutron transport problems in a complex geometry accurately and effectively. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Recent pressure vessel fast fluence calculations have revealed numerical difficulties (spatial oscillations) in the SN solutions, which have persisted in spite of mesh refinement. It is demonstrated that other shielding/deep-penetration applications may be affected; in fact, any SN solution in which the uncollided flux component is significant is likely to exhibit such difficulties. Test problems have been designed to characterize and understand numerical difficulties. Main analyses are performed using the diamond-difference (DD) scheme, which is linear and forms the basis for other (more complex) low-order differencing schemes. The genesis of oscillations is shown to be related to several effects specific for multidimensional geometries as follows: ambiguity in the interpretation of boundary conditions, discontinuities, and different directions of particle streaming and differencing. It has further been explained why the mesh refinement does not produce the intuitively expected results. Other low-order differencing schemes (e.g., the DD with negative flux fixup and the 9-weighted) may partly remedy the situation by reducing the oscillations or by eliminating the oscillations at a cost of "oversmoothing" the results everywhere (e.g., the zero-weighted scheme). These schemes provide more robust solutions, but the inherent difficulties (although reduced) still remain. Types of discontinuities that trigger the oscillations are also examined; it is difficult to envisage an actual practical application free of such discontinuities. The magnitude of numerical difficulties (oscillations) and their practical relevance will depend on all SN model features, the differencing scheme being used, and the application requirements, but this study has shown that they are inherent to multidimensional finite-difference SN algorithms.},

The effects of absorption, multiple scattering, and collimated incidence were considered. Since then, the numerical method has been utilized to study radiative heat transfer in one- and multi-dimensional rectangular, spherical and cylindrical geometries. In this article, the formulation of the discrete-ordinates method is described for computing radiative transfer in a one-dimensional (1D) slab and two-dimensional (2D) rectangular geometries, including the effects of absorbing, emitting and scattering constituents. Both the strengths and the weaknesses of this numerical approach are addressed. The accuracy of available results obtained by utilizing the discrete-ordinates method is compared with other methods of solution for several representative cases. It is evident that major advances have been made related to the development and application of the discrete-ordinates method in multi-dimensional systems.

Then another explanation is offered based on the interpretation of a quadrature formula as a rational approximation of log((z + 1)/(Z - 1)) in the complex plane.

Based on the theory of scalar hyperbolic equations in the Fourier domain, we show that DD performs very well when the boundary data are smooth and the absorption coefficient small. However, because high frequency modes are not damped at all by DD even in the dissipative case, several unphysical modes appear when the boundary conditions are not so smooth.

Remote sensing of the nighttime OI 135.6 nm emissions has been a widely used method for measuring the F region ionospheric plasma densities. In this work, we first develop a comprehensive radiative transfer model from first principles to investigate the effects of different physical processes on the production and transport of the 135.6 nm photons in the ionosphere and then propose a new approach for estimating electron densities from the nightglow. The forward modeling investigation indicates that under certain conditions mutual neutralization can contribute up to ∼38{\%} of the total production of the nighttime 135.6 nm emissions. Moreover, depending on the ionospheric conditions, resonant scattering by atomic oxygen and pure absorption by oxygen molecules can reduce the limb brightness observed by satellite-borne instruments by up to ∼40{\%} while enhancing the brightness viewing in the nadir direction by typically ∼25{\%}. Further analysis shows that without properly addressing these effects in the inversion process, the peak electron density in the F region (NmF2) obtained using limb observations can be overestimated by up to ∼24{\%}. For accurate estimation of the ionospheric electron density, we develop a new type of inverse model that accounts for the effects of mutual neutralization, resonant scattering, and pure absorption. This inversion method requires the knowledge of O and O 2 densities in order to solve the radiative transfer equations. Application of the inverse model to the nighttime ionosphere in the noiseless cases demonstrates that the electron density can be accurately quantified with only ∼1{\%} error in NmF2 and hmF2.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to review recent developments in numerical reconstruction methods for inverse transport problems in imaging applications, mainly optical tomography, fluorescence tomography and bioluminescence tomography. In those inverse problems, one aims at reconstructing physical parameters, such as the absorption coefficient, the scattering coefficient and the fluorescence light source, inside heterogeneousmedia, frompartial knowledge of transport solutions on the boundaries of the media. The physical parameters recovered can be used for diagnostic purpose. Numerical reconstruction techniques for those inverse transport problems can be roughly classified into two categories: linear reconstruction methods and nonlinear reconstruction methods. In the first type of methods, the inverse problems are linearized around some known background to obtain linear inverse problems. Classical regularization techniques are then applied to solve those inverse problems. The second type of methods are either based on regularized nonlinear least-square techniques or based on gradient-driven iterative methods for nonlinear operator equations. In either case, the unknown parameters are iteratively updated until the solutions of the transport equations with the those parameters match the measurements to a certain extent. We review linear and nonlinear reconstruction methods for inverse transport problems in medical imaging with stationary, frequency-domain and time-dependent data. The materials presented include both existing and new results. Meanwhile, we attempt to present similar algorithms for different problems in the same framework to make it more straightforward to generalize those algorithms to other inverse (transport) problems. {\textcopyright} 2010 Global-Science Press.},

abstract = {High-frequency seismograms mainly consist of incoherently scattered waves. Although their phases are more or less random, their envelopes show smooth and stable variations depending on frequency and distance. Envelope modeling can thus be used to infer stochastic parameters of the heterogeneous Earth medium. Radiative transfer theory (RTT) describes energy transport through a random heterogeneous medium neglecting phase information and has been frequently used to simulate observed mean square, (MS) envelopes of high-frequency waves. The radiative transfer equations can be numerically solved by Monte Carlo simulations. So far, mostly isotropic scattering and acoustic approximations have been used. Here we present an extension of the Monte Carlo method to the full elastic case including P, S, and conversion scattering where the single scattering events are described by angular-dependent scattering coefficients in random media which follow from the Born approximation. In order to validate the method, the simulated envelopes are compared to average envelopes obtained by full waveform modeling with a finite difference method in two-dimensional random media with Gaussian and exponential correlation functions. Envelope shapes agree remarkably well for both short and long lapse times and for a broad range of scattering parameters. We conclude that the use of Born scattering coefficients in RTT does not pose severe limits on its validity range. Even in the strong forward scattering regime, envelope broadening and peak amplitude delays can be successfully modeled if one includes the wandering effect as obtained from the parabolic wave equation and Markov approximation into RTT.

abstract = {A new grid-based Boltzmann equation solver, Acuros, was developed specifically for performing accurate and rapid radiotherapy dose calculations. In this study we benchmarked its performance against Monte Carlo for 6 and 18 MV photon beams in heterogeneous media. Acuros solves the coupled Boltzmann transport equations for neutral and charged particles on a locally adaptive Cartesian grid. The Acuros solver is an optimized rewrite of the general purpose Attila software, and for comparable accuracy levels, it is roughly an order of magnitude faster than Attila. Comparisons were made between Monte Carlo (EGSnrc) and Acuros for 6 and 18 MV photon beams impinging on a slab phantom comprising tissue, bone and lung materials. To provide an accurate reference solution, Monte Carlo simulations were run to a tight statistical uncertainty ({\$}\sigma{\$} ≈ 0.1{\%}) and fine resolution (1-2 mm). Acuros results were output on a 2 mm cubic voxel grid encompassing the entire phantom. Comparisons were also made for a breast treatment plan on an anthropomorphic phantom. For the slab phantom in regions where the dose exceeded 10{\%} of the maximum dose, agreement between Acuros and Monte Carlo was within 2{\%} of the local dose or 1 mm distance to agreement. For the breast case, agreement was within 2{\%} of local dose or 2 mm distance to agreement in 99.9{\%} of voxels where the dose exceeded 10{\%} of the prescription dose. Elsewhere, in low dose regions, agreement for all cases was within 1{\%} of the maximum dose. Since all Acuros calculations required less than 5 min on a dual-core two-processor workstation, it is efficient enough for routine clinical use. Additionally, since Acuros calculation times are only weakly dependent on the number of beams, Acuros may ideally be suited to arc therapies, where current clinical algorithms may incur long calculation times. {\textcopyright}2010 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

In this study, proportionality expressions for various orders of numerical smearing errors are derived, and the inherent dependence of such errors on both spatial and angular discretization is found. Ray effect is categorized into two components: local and propagation errors; and they are not independent of spatial discretization. Using DOM solution, the individual and combined impacts of the above-mentioned numerical errors together with the recently discovered angular false scattering error are examined for various spatial and angular discretizations and medium optical properties. The dependence of numerical errors on scattering anisotropy is investigated. It is found that, for low scattering anisotropy, either numerical smearing or ray effect errors dominate, depending on optical thickness and scattering albedo. For high scattering anisotropy, however, the ray effect and angular false scattering dominate.},

abstract = {We study the validity of the time-dependent asymptotic PN approximation in radiative transfer of photons. The time-dependent asymptotic PN is an approximation which uses the standard PN equations with a closure that is based on the asymptotic solution of the exact Boltzmann equation for a homogeneous problem, in space and time. The asymptotic PN approximation for radiative transfer requires careful treatment regarding the closure equation. Specifically, the mean number of particles that are emitted per collision ((Formula presented.)) can be larger than one due to inner or outer radiation sources and the coefficients of the closure must be extended for these cases. Our approximation is tested against a well-known radiative transfer benchmark. It yields excellent results, with almost correct particle velocity that controls the radiative heat-wave fronts.},

abstract = {Optical tomography is a novel imaging modality that is employed to reconstruct cross-sectional images of the optical properties of highly scattering media given measurements performed on the surface of the medium. Recent advances in this field have mainly been driven by biomedical applications in which near-infrared light is used for transillumination and reflectance measurements of highly scattering biological tissues. Many of the reconstruction algorithms currently utilized for optical tomography make use of model-based iterative image reconstruction (MOBIIR) schemes. The imaging problem is formulated as an optimization problem, in which an objective function is minimized. In the simplest case the objective function is a normalized-squared error between measured and predicted data. The predicted data are obtained by using a forward model that describes light propagation in the scattering medium given a certain distribution of optical properties. In part I of this two-part study, we presented a forward model that is based on the time-independent equation of radiative transfer. Using experimental data we showed that this transport-theory-based forward model can accurately predict light propagation in highly scattering media that contain void-like inclusions. In part II we focus on the details of our image reconstruction scheme (inverse model). A crucial component of this scheme involves the efficient and accurate determination of the gradient of the objective function with respect to all optical properties. This calculation is performed using an adjoint differentiation algorithm that allows for fast calculation of this gradient. Having calculated this gradient, we minimize the objective function with a gradient-based optimization method, which results in the reconstruction of the spatial distribution of scattering and absorption coefficients inside the medium. In addition to presenting the mathematical and numerical background of our code, we present reconstruction results based on experimentally obtained data from highly scattering media that contain void-like regions. These types of media play an important role in optical tomographic imaging of the human brain and joints. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new class of solvers for the subsonic compressible Navier-Stokes equations in general two- and three-dimensional multi-domains. Building up on the recent single-domain ADI-based high-order Navier-Stokes solvers (Bruno and Cubillos (2016) [11]) this article presents multi-domain implicit-explicit methods of high-order of temporal accuracy. The proposed methodology incorporates: 1) A novel linear-cost implicit solver based on use of high-order backward differentiation formulae (BDF) and an alternating direction implicit approach (ADI); 2) A fast explicit solver; 3) Nearly dispersionless spectral spatial discretizations; and 4) A domain decomposition strategy that negotiates the interactions between the implicit and explicit domains. In particular, the implicit methodology is quasi-unconditionally stable (it does not suffer from CFL constraints for adequately resolved flows), and it can deliver orders of time accuracy between two and six in the presence of general boundary conditions. As demonstrated via a variety of numerical experiments in two and three dimensions, further, the proposed multi-domain parallel implicit-explicit implementations exhibit high-order convergence in space and time, robust stability properties, limited dispersion, and high parallel efficiency.},

abstract = {Diffuse optical imaging (DOI) is a non invasive technique allowing the recovery of hemodynamic changes in the brain. Due to the diffusive nature of photon propagation in turbid media and the fact that cerebral tissues are located around 1.5 cm under the adult human scalp, DOI measurements are subject to partial volume errors. DOI measurements are also sensitive to large pial vessels because oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin are the dominant chromophores in the near infrared window. In this study, the effect of the extra-cerebral vasculature in proximity of the sagittal sinus was investigated for its impact on DOI measurements simulated over the human adult visual cortex. Numerical Monte Carlo simulations were performed on two specific models of the human head derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The first model included the extra-cerebral vasculature in which constant hemoglobin con- centrations were assumed while the second did not. The screening effect of the vasculature was quantified by comparing recovered hemoglobin changes from each model for different optical arrays and regions of activation. A correction factor accounting for the difference between the recovered and the simulated hemoglobin changes was computed in each case. The results show that changes in hemoglobin concentration are better estimated when the extra-cerebral vasculature is modeled and the correction factors obtained in this case were at least 1.4-fold lower. The effect of the vasculature was also examined in a high-density diffuse optical tomography configuration. In this case, the difference between changes in hemoglobin concentration recovered with each model was reduced down to 10{\%}.},

The objective of this work is the acceleration of the forward model, within a diffusion approximation-based finite-element modeling framework, employing parallelization to expedite the calculation of light propagation in realistic adult head models. The proposed methodology is applicable for modeling both continuous wave and frequency-domain systems with the results demonstrating a 10-fold speed increase when GPU architectures are available, while maintaining high accuracy. It is shown that, for a very high-resolution finite-element model of the adult human head with ∼600,000 nodes, consisting of heterogeneous layers, light propagation can be calculated at ∼0.25 s/excitation source.},

abstract = {Indirect optical spectroscopy or tomography, that is, mapping of optical properties in scattering and absorption inside a medium given a set of measurements at the boundaries, is highly dependent on the radiative transfer model used to track radiative energy propagation in semi-transparent materials. In the first part of this study, a numerical tool adapted for treating radiative transfer in the frame of short-pulsed laser beam interaction with non-homogeneous matter has been presented. In this paper, it is intended to show how such numerical tools can undergo inversion through adjoint treatment or reverse differentiation. Adjoint models, as well as reverse differentiation, are used in order to allow an efficient computation of the gradient, in the unknown optical parameters space, of an objective or cost function estimating the residual between data obtained at the boundary and predictions by numerical simulations. This gradient is a crucial indication as to update, through line minimization, the set of internal optical properties of the medium. First, the theoretical background of the inverse treatments, both reverse differentiation and adjoint model, for the transient radiative transfer equation model introduced in Part I is developed. Second, different reconstruction configurations are presented. Time-dependent sampling and time filtering effects of the measurements are addressed. Image reconstructions from simulated data are achieved for material phantoms of simple geometry. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsveier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We report on the derivation and implementation of the first three-dimensional optical tomographic image reconstruction scheme that is based on the time-independent equation of radiative transfer (ERT) and allows for arbitrarily shaped medium boundaries and arbitrary spatial material distributions. The scheme builds on the concept of model-based iterative image reconstruction, in which a forward model provides prediction of detector readings, and a gradient-based updating scheme minimizes an appropriately defined objective function. The forward model is solved by using an even-parity formulation of the ERT which lends itself to a finite-element discretization method. The finite-element technique provides the suitable framework for predicting light propagation in arbitrarily shaped three-dimensional media. For an efficient way of calculating the gradient of the objective function we have implemented an adjoint differentiation scheme. Initial reconstruction results using synthetic data from simple media and a three-dimensional mesh of the human forehead illustrate the performance of the code. (C) 2003 SPIE and IST.},

abstract = {We present a Fourier continuation (FC) algorithm for the solution of the fully nonlinear compressible Navier-Stokes equations in general spatial domains. The new scheme is based on the recently introduced accelerated FC method, which enables use of highly accurate Fourier expansions as the main building block of general-domain PDE solvers. Previous FC-based PDE solvers are restricted to linear scalar equations with constant coefficients. The FC methodology presented in this text thus constitutes a significant generalization of the previous FC schemes, as it yields general-domain FC solvers for nonlinear systems of PDEs. While not restricted to periodic boundary conditions and therefore applicable to general boundary value problems on arbitrary domains, the proposed algorithm inherits many of the highly desirable properties arising from rapidly convergent Fourier expansions, including high-order convergence, essentially spectrally accurate dispersion relations, and much milder CFL constraints than those imposed by polynomial-based spectral methods-since, for example, the spectral radius of the FC first derivative grows linearly with the number of spatial discretization points. We demonstrate the accuracy and optimal parallel efficiency of the algorithm in a variety of scientific and engineering contexts relevant to fluid-dynamics and nonlinear acoustics. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the potential role of optical tomography in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum with ultrasonographic (US) localization as a means of differentiating early-stage cancers from benign lesions of the breast. Materials and Methods: The protocol was approved by the institutional review boards and was HIPAA compliant; all participants signed an informed consent. One hundred seventy-eight consecutive women (mean age, 52 years; range, 21-89 years) who underwent US-guided biopsy were imaged with a hand-held probe consisting of a coregistered US transducer and an NIR imager. The lesion location provided by coregistered US was used to guide optical imaging. Light absorption was measured at two optical wavelengths. From this measurement, tumor angiogenesis was assessed on the basis of calculated total hemoglobin concentration (tHb) and was correlated with core biopsy results. For patients diagnosed with carcinomas and followed up with subsequent excision, the tHb was correlated with pathologic parameters. Results: There were two in situ carcinomas (Tis), 35 T1 carcinomas, 24 T2-T4 carcinomas, and 114 benign lesions. The mean maximum and mean average tHb of the Tis-T1 group were 102.0 $\mu$mol/L ± 28.5 (standard deviation) and 71.9 $\mu$mol/L ± 18.8, and those of the T2-T4 group were 100.3 $\mu$mol/L ± 26.4 and 67.0 $\mu$mol/L ± 18.3, respectively. The mean maximum and mean average tHb of the benign group were 55.1 $\mu$mol/L ± 22.7 and 39.1 $\mu$mol/L ± 14.9, respectively. Both mean maximum and mean average tHb levels were significantly higher in the malignant groups than they were in the benign group(P {\textless} .001). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for Tis-T1 cancers were 92{\%}, 93{\%}, 81{\%}, and 97{\%}. The corresponding values for T2-T4 tumors were 75{\%}, 93{\%}, 69{\%}, and 95{\%}. Conclusion: The angiogenesis (tHb) contrast imaged by using the NIR technique with US holds promise as an adjunct to mammography and US for distinguishing early-stage invasive breast cancers from benign lesions. {\textcopyright} RSNA, 2010.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to review recent developments in numerical reconstruction methods for inverse transport problems in imaging applications, mainly optical tomography, fluorescence tomography and bioluminescence tomography. In those inverse problems, one aims at reconstructing physical parameters, such as the absorption coefficient, the scattering coefficient and the fluorescence light source, inside heterogeneousmedia, frompartial knowledge of transport solutions on the boundaries of the media. The physical parameters recovered can be used for diagnostic purpose. Numerical reconstruction techniques for those inverse transport problems can be roughly classified into two categories: linear reconstruction methods and nonlinear reconstruction methods. In the first type of methods, the inverse problems are linearized around some known background to obtain linear inverse problems. Classical regularization techniques are then applied to solve those inverse problems. The second type of methods are either based on regularized nonlinear least-square techniques or based on gradient-driven iterative methods for nonlinear operator equations. In either case, the unknown parameters are iteratively updated until the solutions of the transport equations with the those parameters match the measurements to a certain extent. We review linear and nonlinear reconstruction methods for inverse transport problems in medical imaging with stationary, frequency-domain and time-dependent data. The materials presented include both existing and new results. Meanwhile, we attempt to present similar algorithms for different problems in the same framework to make it more straightforward to generalize those algorithms to other inverse (transport) problems. {\textcopyright} 2010 Global-Science Press.},

abstract = {In this paper we address an inverse problem for the time-dependent linear transport equation (or radiative transfer equation) in 2D having in mind applications in diffuse optical tomography (DOT). We propose two new reconstruction algorithms which so far have not been applied to such a situation and compare their performances in certain practically relevant situations. The first of these reconstruction algorithms uses a sparsity promoting regularization scheme, whereas the second one uses a simultaneous level set reconstruction scheme for two parameters of the linear transport equation. We will also compare the results of both schemes with a third scheme which is a more traditional L 2-based Landweber-Kaczmarz scheme. We focus our attention on the DOT application of imaging the human head of a neonate where the simpler diffusion approximation is not well-suited for the inversion due to the presence of a clear layer beneath the skull which is filled with 'low-scattering' cerebrospinal fluid. This layer, even if its location and characteristics are known a priori, poses significant difficulties for most reconstruction schemes due to its 'wave-guiding' property which reduces sensitivity of the data to the interior regions. A further complication arises due to the necessity to reconstruct simultaneously two different parameters of the linear transport equation, the scattering and the absorption cross-section, from the same data set. A significant 'cross-talk' between these two parameters is usually expected. Our numerical experiments indicate that each of the three considered reconstruction schemes do have their merits and perform differently but reasonably well when the clear layer is a priori known. We also demonstrate the behavior of the three algorithms in the particular situation where the clear layer is unknown during the reconstruction.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Angiogenesis in advanced breast cancers is highly distorted and heterogeneous. Noninvasive imaging that can monitor angiogenesis may be invaluable initially for diagnosis and then for assessing tumor response to treatment. By combining ultrasound (US) and near-infrared (NlR) optical imaging, a reliable new technique has emerged for localizing and characterizing tumor angiogenesis within the breast. METHODS: This new technique employs a commercial US transducer coupled with an array of NIR optical fibers mounted on a hand-held probe. The US image is used for lesion localization and for guiding optical imaging reconstruction. Optical sensors are used for imaging tumor total hemoglobin distribution, which is directly related to tumor angiogenesis. RESULTS: Six large breast carcinomas were studied and mlcrovessel density count was then performed on tissue samples obtained from these cancers. Two patients had locally advanced breast cancers and received neoadjuvant chemotherapy for 3 months. In one patient, before chemotherapy, the total hemoglobin distribution showed a high concentration at the cancer periphery; the distribution was later confined to the core area after 3 months of treatment. In another patient, as treatment progressed, the maximum hemoglobin concentration decreased from 255.3, to 147.5, to 76.9 $\mu$mol/l with an associated reduction in spatial extension. The other four patients had cancers of 2.0 to 3.0 cm in size and were imaged either at the time of core biopsy or definitive surgery. The histologic microvessel density counts from these tumor samples correlate to hemoglobin distributions with a correlation coefficient of 0.64 (P {\textless} .05). CONCLUSION: These initial results suggest that this new imaging technique may have great potential in imaging the heterogeneous vascular distribution of larger breast cancers in vivo and in monitoring treatment-related changes in angiogenesis during chemotherapy.

The RDOM is used to solve the radiative transfer problem in one-dimensional anisotropically scattering media with complex phase function. The radiative heat fluxes obtained by the RDOM are compared with those obtained by the conventional discrete ordinates method (CDOM) and Monte Carlo method.

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2015. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. Remote sensing of the nighttime OI 135.6 nm emissions has been a widely used method for measuring the F region ionospheric plasma densities. In this work, we first develop a comprehensive radiative transfer model from first principles to investigate the effects of different physical processes on the production and transport of the 135.6 nm photons in the ionosphere and then propose a new approach for estimating electron densities from the nightglow. The forward modeling investigation indicates that under certain conditions mutual neutralization can contribute up to ∼38{\%} of the total production of the nighttime 135.6 nm emissions. Moreover, depending on the ionospheric conditions, resonant scattering by atomic oxygen and pure absorption by oxygen molecules can reduce the limb brightness observed by satellite-borne instruments by up to ∼40{\%} while enhancing the brightness viewing in the nadir direction by typically ∼25{\%}. Further analysis shows that without properly addressing these effects in the inversion process, the peak electron density in the F region (NmF2) obtained using limb observations can be overestimated by up to ∼24{\%}. For accurate estimation of the ionospheric electron density, we develop a new type of inverse model that accounts for the effects of mutual neutralization, resonant scattering, and pure absorption. This inversion method requires the knowledge of O and O 2 densities in order to solve the radiative transfer equations. Application of the inverse model to the nighttime ionosphere in the noiseless cases demonstrates that the electron density can be accurately quantified with only ∼1{\%} error in NmF2 and hmF2.},

abstract = {Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses light-activated drugs to treat diseases ranging from cancer to age-related macular degeneration and antibiotic-resistant infections. This paper reviews the current status of PDT with an emphasis on the contributions of physics, biophysics and technology, and the challenges remaining in the optimization and adoption of this treatment modality. A theme of the review is the complexity of PDT dosimetry due to the dynamic nature of the three essential components -- light, photosensitizer and oxygen. Considerable progress has been made in understanding the problem and in developing instruments to measure all three, so that optimization of individual PDT treatments is becoming a feasible target. The final section of the review introduces some new frontiers of research including low dose rate (metronomic) PDT, two-photon PDT, activatable PDT molecular beacons and nanoparticle-based PDT.},

Uniform and non-uniform diffuse loadings on the top boundary are considered. The intensity is broken into direct and diffuse components. The direct component is determined analytically, and the diffuse transport equation is solved numerically by conventional discrete ordinates procedure. Results are presented for various aspect ratios, media extinction properties, and loading parameters. The standard discrete ordinates solution exhibits anomalies in the flux leaving the bottom which are attributed to 'ray-effects'. Large errors are observed when the aspect ralio is small. Numerical results obtained using the modified discrete ordinates scheme compare well with benchmark solutions and show no anomalies in the bottom flux.

The sequential nature of the sweep process makes the parallelization of the overall algorithm the most challenging aspect. Several parallel sweep algorithms, which represent different options of interleaving communications and calculations in the solution process, are analysed. The option of grouping messages by means of buffering is also considered. One of the heuristics proposed consistently stands out as the best option in all the situations analyzed, which include different geometries and different sizes of the ordinate set. With this algorithm, good scalability results have been achieved regarding both weak and strong speedup tests with up to 2560 CPUs. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

In this interpretation, the geometric patterns onto which the residuals are backprojected are given by the same absorption and scattering transport sensitivity functions which decompose the forward residual operator. Moreover, the 'backtransport' procedure, which has been introduced in an earlier paper by the author, can then be interpreted as an efficient scheme for 'backprojecting' all (filtered) residuals corresponding to one source position simultaneously into the parameter space by just solving one adjoint transport problem.

The radiative transfer equation being integro-differential, the discrete ordinates method allows to write down a set of semi-discrete equations in which weights are to be calculated. The calculation of these weights is well known to be based on either a quadrature or on angular discretization, making the use of such method straightforward for the state equation. Also, the diffuse contribution of reflection on borders is usually well taken into account. However, the calculation of accurate partition ratio coefficients is much more tricky for the specular condition applied on arbitrary geometrical borders. This paper presents algorithms that calculate analytically partition ratio coefficients needed in numerical treatments. The developed algorithms, combined with a decentered finite element scheme, are validated with the help of comparisons with analytical solutions before being applied on complex geometries.},

abstract = {A method is presented for solving initial and boundary value problems for the energy dependent and one speed neutron transport equations. It consists in constructing an asymptotic expansion of the neutron density $\psi$(r, v, $\tau$) with respect to a small parameter $\epsilon$, which is the ratio of a typical mean free path of a neutron to a typical dimension of the domain under consideration. The density $\psi$ is expressed as the sum of an interior part $\psi$i, a boundary layer part $\psi$b, and an initial layer part $\psi$0. Then $\psi$i is sought as a power series in $\epsilon$, while $\psi$b decays exponentially with distance from a boundary or interface at a rate proportional to $\epsilon$-1. Similarly $\psi$0 decays at a rate proportional to $\epsilon$-1 with time after the initial time. For a near critical reactor, the leading term in $\psi$i is determined by a diffusion equation. The leading term in $\psi$b is determined by a half-space problem with a plane boundary. The initial and boundary conditions for the diffusion equation are obtained by requiring $\psi$0 and $\psi$b to decay away from the initial instant and from the boundary, respectively. The results are illustrated by specializing them to the one speed case. The method may make it possible to treat more realistic and more complex problems than can be handled by other methods.

abstract = {Optical tomography (OT) recovers the cross-sectional distribution of optical parameters inside a highly scattering medium from information contained in measurements that are performed on the boundaries of the medium. The image reconstruction problem in OT can be considered as a large-scale optimization problem, in which an appropriately defined objective function needs to be minimized. In the simplest case, the objective function is the least-square error norm between the measured and the predicted data. In biomedical applications that apply near-infrared light as the probing tool the predictions are obtained from a model of light propagation in tissue. Gradient techniques are commonly used as optimization methods, which employ the gradient of the objective function with respect to the optical parameters to find the minimum. Conjugate gradient (CG) techniques that use information about the first derivative of the objective function have shown some good results in the past. However, this approach is frequently characterized by low convergence rates. To alleviate this problem we have implemented and studied so-called quasi-Newton (QN) methods, which use approximations to the second derivative. The performance of the QN and CG methods are compared by utilizing both synthetic and experimental data.},

abstract = {Currently available tomographic image reconstruction schemes for optical tomography (OT) are mostly based on the limiting assumptions of small perturbations and a priori knowledge of the optical properties of a reference medium. Furthermore, these algorithms usually require the inversion of large, full, ill-conditioned Jacobian matrixes. In this work a gradient-based iterative image reconstruction (GIIR) method is presented that promises to overcome current limitations. The code consists of three major parts: 1) A finite-difference, time-resolved, diffusion forward model is used to predict detector readings based on the spatial distribution of optical properties; 2) An objective function that describes the difference between predicted and measured data: 3) An updating method that uses the gradient of the objective function in a line minimization scheme to provide subsequent guesses of the spatial distribution of the optical properties for the forward model. The reconstruction of these properties is completed, once a minimum of this objective function is found. After a presentation of the mathematical background, two- and three-dimensional reconstruction of simple heterogeneous media as well as the clinically relevant example of ventricular bleeding in the brain are discussed. Numerical studies suggest that intraventricular hemorrhages can be detected using the GIIR technique, even in the presence of a heterogeneous background.},

The intensities in the photographic region of the spectrum were calibrated by means of the Polar Sequence stars. The mean of four such runs across the Milky Way, on circles of nearly constant longitude, l = 40 degrees, shows a maximum of brightness of 80 stars of the tenth magnitude per square degree for the diffuse extra-terrestrial radiation. The mean of three runs near l = 140 degrees shows a maximum of 35 in the same units. It is shown that the observed intensity of diffuse light may be explained as scattered stellar radiation if the phase function governing the scattering of starlight by the interstellar matter is strongly forward- throwing. The concentration of the diffuse light toward the galactic circle is also in agreement with this property of the phase function. The observations also indicate that the scattering efficiency, or albedo, of the particles is greater than 0.3.},

abstract = {Numerical modeling of light propagation in random media has been an important issue for biomedical imaging, including diffuse optical tomography (DOT). For high resolution DOT, accurate and fast computation of light propagation in biological tissue is desirable. This paper proposes a space-time hybrid model for numerical modeling based on the radiative transfer and diffusion equations (RTE and DE, respectively) in random media under refractive-index mismatching. In the proposed model, the RTE and DE regions are separated into space and time by using a crossover length and the time from the ballistic regime to the diffusive regime, $\rho$DA{\~{}}10/$\mu$t' and tDA{\~{}}20/v$\mu$t' where $\mu$t' and v represent a reduced transport coefficient and light velocity, respectively. The present model succeeds in describing light propagation accurately and reduces computational load by a quarter compared with full computation of the RTE. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The medium in the enclosure is gray and absorbs, emits, and anisotropically scatters radiative energy. General Mie-anisotropic phase functions are treated by Legendre polynomial expansions. The average incident radiations and the radiative heat fluxes are presented in graphical and tabular forms. The phase function anisotropy plays a significant role in the radiation heat transfer when the boundary condition is nonsymmetric, but it is not important for symmetric environments. Side wall heat losses are significant for back scattering phase functions, moderate optical thicknesses, large scattering albedos, and small reflectivities. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {Many methods are available for the solution of radiative heat transfer problems in participating media. Among these, the discrete ordinates method (DOM) and the finite volume method (FVM) are among the most widely used ones. They provide a good compromise between accuracy and computational requirements, and they are relatively easy to integrate in CFD codes. This paper surveys recent advances on these numerical methods. Developments concerning the grid structure (e.g., new formulations for axisymmetrical geometries, body-fitted structured and unstructured meshes, embedded boundaries, multi-block grids, local grid refinement), the spatial discretization scheme, and the angular discretization scheme are described. Progress related to the solution accuracy, solution algorithm, alternative formulations, such as the modified DOM and FVM, even-parity formulation, discrete-ordinates interpolation method and method of lines, and parallelization strategies is addressed. The application to non-gray media, variable refractive index media, and transient problems is also reviewed. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Diffuse optical imaging is an emerging modality that uses Near Infrared (NIR) light to reveal structural and functional information of deep biological tissue. It provides contrast mechanisms for molecular, chemical, and anatomical imaging that is not available from other imaging modalities. Diffuse Optical Tomography (DOT) deals with 3D reconstruction of optical properties of tissue given the measurements and a forward model of photon propagation. DOT has inherently low spatial resolution due to diffuse nature of photons. In this work, we focus to improve the spatial resolution and the quantitative accuracy of DOT by using a priori anatomical information specific to unknown image. Such specific a priori information can be obtained from a secondary high-resolution imaging modality such as Magnetic Resonance (MR) or X-ray. Image reconstruction is formulated within a Bayesian framework to determine the spatial distribution of the absorption coefficients of the medium. A spatially varying a priori probability density function is designed based on the segmented anatomical information. Conjugate gradient method is utilized to solve the resulting optimization problem. Proposed method is evaluated using simulation and phantom measurements collected with a novel time-resolved optical imaging system. Results demonstrate that the proposed method leads to improved spatial resolution, quantitative accuracy and faster convergence than standard least squares approach.},

Ultrasound-guided diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is a promising imaging technique that maps hemoglobin concentrations of breast lesions to assist ultrasound (US) for cancer diagnosis and treatment monitoring. The accurate recovery of breast lesion optical properties requires an effective image reconstruction method. We introduce a reconstruction approach in which US images are encoded as prior information for regularization of the inversion matrix. The framework of this approach is based on image reconstruction package "NIRFAST." We compare this approach to the US-guided dual-zone mesh reconstruction method, which is based on Born approximation and conjugate gradient optimization developed in our laboratory. Results were evaluated using phantoms and clinical data. This method improves classification of malignant and benign lesions by increasing malignant to benign lesion absorption contrast. The results also show improvements in reconstructed lesion shapes and the spatial distribution of absorption maps.},
